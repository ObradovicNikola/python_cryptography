Exercise 1.3. A Strong Substitution Cipher 
What if instead of shifting the alphabet, you randomly jumbled the letters? Create a program
that encodes and decodes messages using this kind of substitution. 
Some newspapers publish puzzles like this called cryptograms. 

Exercise 1.4. Count The Dictionaries 
How many substitution dictionaries are possible for the cryptogram-style substitution in the
previous exercise? 

Exercise 1.5. Identifying The Dictionary 
Modify your cryptogram program so that you can identify and pick the jumbled character
substitution map with a number. That is, each mapping has a unique number that identifies it:
picking substitution n should create the same substitution mapping every time. This exercise is
a little tougher than the others. Do your best! 

Exercise 1.6. Brute Force 
Try having your cryptogram-decoding program brute force a message. How long would it take
to test every possible mapping? Can you write a program that can speed this up with any kind
of “smart guess”?
